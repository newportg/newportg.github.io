# Method 1

## Introduction

This is the introduction to my long blog post.

{{< include chapter1.qmd >}}

{{< include chapter2.qmd >}}

... and so on for other chapters.

### Pros
- All documents appear in the Table of Contents

### Cons 
- Forward and backward navigation of Books is lost.
- Doesn't handle sub pages. everything is one level.
- All the documents appear as a single document.

# Method 2

1. Create a separate Quarto Book project
   1. Store it in GitHub
   2. Publish it.
2. Reference the Book project from your blog page.

## Conclusion
Neither of these solutions is very satisfactory, as Quarto seems to forget the basic tenants of Wiki's.
Method 1 is useful if you only have simple documents.
Method 2 is useful but you will have issues with duplication of the home page of the book, or do you make the website blog post just a link ?
