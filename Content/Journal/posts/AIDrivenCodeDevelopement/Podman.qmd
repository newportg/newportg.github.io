# Introduction
I was about to dive into the difficulty of installing Podman on Windows, But fortuately due to a convientent system rebuild I had a clean Windows 11 install and I was able to install Podman without any issues.

1. Install Podman Desktop from the [Podman Windows Desktop](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/releases/download/v1.25.1/podman-desktop-1.25.1-setup.exe) page.
1. Install Podman CLI from the [Podman Windows CLI](https://github.com/containers/podman/releases/download/v5.8.0/podman-5.8.0-setup.exe) page.
1. Install WSL2 from the [Podman Windows](https://podman.io/getting-started/installation#podman-on-windows) page.
