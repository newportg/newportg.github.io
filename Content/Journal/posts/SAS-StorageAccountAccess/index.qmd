## Best practices when using SAS
When you use shared access signatures in your applications, you need to be aware of two potential risks:

* If a SAS is leaked, it can be used by anyone who obtains it, which can potentially compromise your storage account.
* If a SAS provided to a client application expires and the application is unable to retrieve a new SAS from your service, then the application's functionality may be hindered.

The following recommendations for using shared access signatures can help mitigate these risks:

* **Always use HTTPS** to create or distribute a SAS. If a SAS is passed over HTTP and intercepted, an attacker performing a man-in-the-middle attack is able to read the SAS and then use it just as the intended user could have, potentially compromising sensitive data or allowing for data corruption by the malicious user.
* **Reference stored access policies where possible.** Stored access policies give you the option to revoke permissions without having to regenerate the storage account keys. Set the expiration on these very far in the future (or infinite) and make sure it's regularly updated to move it farther into the future.
* **Use near-term expiration times on an ad hoc SAS.** In this way, even if a SAS is compromised, it's valid only for a short time. This practice is especially important if you cannot reference a stored access policy. Near-term expiration times also limit the amount of data that can be written to a blob by limiting the time available to upload to it.
* **Have clients automatically renew the SAS if necessary.** Clients should renew the SAS well before the expiration, in order to allow time for retries if the service providing the SAS is unavailable. If your SAS is meant to be used for a small number of immediate, short-lived operations that are expected to be completed within the expiration period, then this may be unnecessary as the SAS is not expected to be renewed. However, if you have client that is routinely making requests via SAS, then the possibility of expiration comes into play. The key consideration is to balance the need for the SAS to be short-lived (as previously stated) with the need to ensure that the client is requesting renewal early enough (to avoid disruption due to the SAS expiring prior to successful renewal).
**Be careful with SAS start time.** If you set the start time for a SAS to now, then due to clock skew (differences in current time according to different machines), failures may be observed intermittently for the first few minutes. In general, set the start time to be at least 15 minutes in the past. Or, don't set it at all, which will make it valid immediately in all cases. The same generally applies to expiry time as well--remember that you may observe up to 15 minutes of clock skew in either direction on any request. For clients using a REST version prior to 2012-02-12, the maximum duration for a SAS that does not reference a stored access policy is 1 hour, and any policies specifying longer term than that will fail.
* **Be specific with the resource to be accessed.** A security best practice is to provide a user with the minimum required privileges. If a user only needs read access to a single entity, then grant them read access to that single entity, and not read/write/delete access to all entities. This also helps lessen the damage if a SAS is compromised because the SAS has less power in the hands of an attacker.
* **Understand that your account will be billed for any usage, including that done with SAS.** If you provide write access to a blob, a user may choose to upload a 200GB blob. If you've given them read access as well, they may choose to download it 10 times, incurring 2 TB in egress costs for you. Again, provide limited permissions to help mitigate the potential actions of malicious users. Use short-lived SAS to reduce this threat (but be mindful of clock skew on the end time).
* **Validate data written using SAS.** When a client application writes data to your storage account, keep in mind that there can be problems with that data. If your application requires that data be validated or authorized before it is ready to use, you should perform this validation after the data is written and before it is used by your application. This practice also protects against corrupt or malicious data being written to your account, either by a user who properly acquired the SAS, or by a user exploiting a leaked SAS.
* **Don't always use SAS.** Sometimes the risks associated with a particular operation against your storage account outweigh the benefits of SAS. For such operations, create a middle-tier service that writes to your storage account after performing business rule validation, authentication, and auditing. Also, sometimes it's simpler to manage access in other ways. For example, if you want to make all blobs in a container publicly readable, you can make the container Public, rather than providing a SAS to every client for access.
* **Use Storage Analytics to monitor your application.** You can use logging and metrics to observe any spike in authentication failures due to an outage in your SAS provider service or to the inadvertent removal of a stored access policy. See the Azure Storage Team Blog for additional information.

## Authorization
* Azure Active Directory
  * Considered to be the most secure, as access is keyed to the users AD roles and permissions.
* Shared Key
  * The Shared Key is the 'Root key' to the storage account, and has access to perform all operations.
  * This should not be shared or distributed.
* Shared Access Signature
  * SAS tokens can be generated, and allow access to resources. The SAS tokens can be limited to:-
  * Time
  * IP address
  * User
* Anonymous access to containers and blobs
  * You can set the storage account, so that anyone can access blobs or containers. This is obviously the least secure
