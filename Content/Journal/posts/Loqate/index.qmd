# Loqate
Loqate is a service which supplies addresses and geocoding for a given search string.
The Loqate service employs a iterative id base system where by, if you supply the id to subsequent calls then you will get narrower results. When you receive a result of type 'Address' then you can call Loqate's Retrieve api call to get that items address details.
