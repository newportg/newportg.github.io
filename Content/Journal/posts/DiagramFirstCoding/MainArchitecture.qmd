# Main Architecture Page (index.md)
This page contains the C4 model script. You can render this using the Structurizr CLI or the Structurizr Lite Docker container.

```kroki-Structurizr
workspace "System Workspace" "Architecture for API-driven services" {

    model {
        user = person "User" "A customer of the system"
        
        system = softwareSystem "Order Management System" {
            apiService = container "API Service" "Handles incoming requests" "Node.js/TypeScript"
            engineService = container "Rules Engine" "Processes business logic" "Java/Drools"
            
            user -> apiService "Makes API calls to" "JSON/HTTPS"
            apiService -> engineService "Validates rules via" "gRPC"
        }
    }

    views {
        container system "SystemContext" {
            include *
            autolayout lr
        }
    }
}
```

## Workflow
*  Receive Request: Validate JSON schema against TypeSpec model.
*  Auth Check: Verify JWT via Identity Provider.
*  Rule Delegation: Forward payload to the Rules Engine.
*  Persistence: Save result to the database.
