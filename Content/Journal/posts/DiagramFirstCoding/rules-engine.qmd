# Component: Rules Engine (rules-engine.md)

This sub-page defines the logic used by the business engine (e.g., Drools or NRule).
Business Rules (Logic Engine)

|Rule ID|	Name|	Condition|	Action|
|-------|-------|-----------|-------|
|BR-001|	High Value Review|	order.amount > 10000|	Set status = "manual_review"|
|BR-002|	New Customer Discount|	customer.isNew == true|	Apply discount = 0.10|
|BR-003|	Blacklist Check|	customer.id in blacklist|	Set status = "rejected"|

## Rule Execution Workflow (DMN)
Input: Order and Customer objects.

*  Evaluation: Execute "Blacklist Check" first (Priority 1).
*  Calculation: If not rejected, calculate discounts.
*  Output: Return modified Order object to API Service.

## Implementation Tools

* Architecture Rendering: Use the Structurizr Visualizer to paste the script from index.md.
* API Validation: Compile the TypeSpec code into OpenAPI using the TypeSpec Compiler.
* Logic Testing: Import the Business Rules table into a Decision Model and Notation (DMN) tool for execution.
