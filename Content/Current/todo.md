# To Do's
- [ ] Title Service (Land Registry or Nimbus)
  - Still not heard anything from Al concerning Nimbus
    - [ ] If we go with Nimbus, which sounds likely as the cost is lower, we will have to rename the project.
    - [ ] If we change the title to a different name, we should investigate using multiple services, so we can support Scotland and Northern Ireland and any other country as they come along.
  - MyKf
    - [ ] Investigate how MyKf will save the data in the hub db
    - [ ] Investigate what MyKf will save in the database
    - [X] Talk to Katy to find out who is the developer
      - Rams Solaiappan


- [ ] Quarto
  - [ ] Plantuml plugin

    - [X] [Accepts a Puml file as a attribute](/Content/Current/posts/2025-10-14/index.qmd)
    - [X] [Accepts inline PlantUML code](/Content/Current/posts/2025-10-14/index.qmd)
      - [X] Creates a local puml file if inline code is used
    - [X] [Renders the PlantUML diagram as SVG](/Content/Current/posts/2025-10-14/index.qmd)
    - [X] [Renders puml files in the current directory.](/Content/Current/posts/2025-10-14/index.qmd)
    - [ ] Works with subdirectories
    - [ ] Direct where to store the generated SVG files
        - Quarto and LUA processing executes relative to the location of the .qmd file. So we will need a method to identify which directory we are in so we can then redirect the output files to a specified subdirectory.
    - [X] [Create a GitHub repo for the filter](/Content/Current/posts/2025-10-14/index.qmd)

    - [X] [Document the filter as a journal entry](/Content//Journal/posts/PlantumlQuartoFilter/index.qmd)
    - [ ] Echo script rather than create puml file.
        - Executing a 'Echo' command terminates when it reaches a line break. So we will need to replace all line breaks with a special character sequence, e.g. '\n' and then use a script to replace the special character sequence with a line break.
        Currently the directory is littered with intermediate .puml files which are not needed once the diagram has been created.
