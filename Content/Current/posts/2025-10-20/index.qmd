# 2025-10-20

- Diabetes
  - Continued the Diabetes online course.
- Quarto
  - Created a example SAD Website - Quarto-Frontify
- Journal
  - Changed the Journal template to create named directories for each post rather than date based directories. This makes it easier to manage posts with similar dates.
  - One thing to note is that the directory created includes spaces, which should be removed otherwise you have to replace them with '%20' in any WikiLink :(
    - Looking for a method to camelcase the '${FOAM-TITLE}' variable.
