    "text": "Each component is a separately deploy-able artefact, but we need a coherent single URL to link them all. The normal method would be to deploy out each individual component to Azure and each would get its own ‘aurewebsites.com’ URL. This approach would lead to confusion, as it would mean you would need to keep lists of URL’s By using the proxy feature of Azure Functions we can define routes to each of the installed artefacts while preserving a single URL for the application. So:-\n\n\n\nRoute\nResult\n\n\n\n\nzoomalong.co.uk\nWebsite\n\n\nzoomalong.co.uk/api\nAzure functions\n\n\nzoomalong.co.uk/static\nAzure Storage Account\n\n\n\nUsed to store any files or images etc. Because both the API and Web Application exist on the same URL then we won’t run into any CORS issues.

    "text": "Description\nAPI First is an approach to software development that prioritizes the design and implementation of APIs before building the underlying application or service. This approach emphasizes the importance of APIs as the primary means of communication between different components of a system, as well as between different systems.\nBy designing APIs first, developers can ensure that the APIs are well-defined, consistent, and easy to use. This can lead to better collaboration between teams, faster development cycles, and more efficient integration with third-party services.\nThe approach detailed here takes the responsibility for creating the API definition away from the developer and places it in the hands of a specialist tool. This ensures that the API definition is created in a consistent manner and adheres to best practices. The API definition is then used to generate the client and server code, which can be integrated into the application or service. This approach can help to reduce errors and inconsistencies in the code, as well as improve the overall quality of the API. The API First approach can be particularly beneficial in complex systems where multiple teams are working on different components. By defining the APIs first, teams can work independently while still ensuring that their components will integrate seamlessly with the rest of the system. The API First approach can also help to improve the overall user experience of the application or service. By designing APIs that are easy to use and understand, developers can create applications that are more intuitive and user-friendly. Overall, the API First approach is a powerful way to improve the development process and create high-quality applications and services that are built around well-designed APIs."

    "section": "",
    "text": "A web application, also known as a web app, is a software application that runs on web browsers and is accessed over the internet. It is designed to provide interactive and dynamic functionality to users, like traditional desktop applications, but with the advantage of being platform-independent and accessible from any device with a web browser.\nWeb applications are typically built using web technologies such as HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), and JavaScript, which enable the creation of interactive user interfaces and the manipulation of data. The application’s logic is executed on the server and/or client side, depending on the architecture employed.\nWeb applications can vary widely in their complexity and functionality, ranging from simple websites with basic forms and interactivity to more advanced applications that involve complex data processing, real-time communication, and collaboration. Examples of web applications include online banking systems, social media platforms, e-commerce websites, project management tools, and web-based email clients.\nOne of the key advantages of web applications is their ability to deliver updates and improvements seamlessly, as they are centrally hosted and accessed over the internet. This eliminates the need for users to manually install software updates, resulting in a more efficient and user-friendly experience.\n\n\nSSR (Server-Side Rendering), SSG (Static Site Generation), SPA (Single-Page Application), PWA (Progressive Web Application), Isomorphic, and Micro Frontend architectures are different approaches to building web applications, each with its own characteristics and benefits.\n\n\nSSR is an approach where the server generates the complete HTML for each request and sends it to the client. The client receives a fully rendered page, including content and data. SSR is beneficial for improving initial page load time and search engine optimization (SEO) since search engines can easily crawl and index the content.\n\n\n\nSSR\n\n\n\n\n\nSSG is a method of generating static HTML files during the build process based on predefined templates and data. These static files can then be served to clients without the need for server-side processing. SSG provides fast page loads, reduces server load, and enables caching benefits. It is well-suited for content-based websites and blogs with less dynamic content.\n\n\n\nSSG\n\n\n\n\n\nSPA is an application that loads a single HTML page initially and then dynamically updates its content using JavaScript, typically through API calls. The client-side JavaScript handles the rendering of views and the manipulation of data. SPAs provide a smooth and responsive user experience, as they avoid full page reloads. Examples include Gmail and Trello.\n\n\n\nSPA\n\n\n\n\n\nPWA is an application that combines the features of web and mobile apps. PWAs are built using web technologies and provide an app-like experience to users, including offline capabilities, push notifications, and access to device features. PWAs can be installed on the user’s device and are accessible through the home screen, bridging the gap between web and native apps.\n\n\n\nPWA\n\n\n\n\n\nIsomorphic applications aim to create a consistent codebase that can run both on the server and the client. The goal is to share as much code as possible between the server and the client, enabling server-side rendering for improved initial load times and search engine friendliness while still providing interactive client-side functionality.\n\n\n\nISO\n\n\n\n\n\nMicro Frontend is an architectural approach that focuses on breaking down a web application into smaller, self-contained frontend modules. Each module can be developed, tested, and deployed independently, often by different teams. Micro Frontend allows for better scalability, flexibility, and autonomy in the frontend development process.\n\n\n\nmicrofrontend\n\n\nIt’s important to note that these architectures are not mutually exclusive, and elements of each can be combined to suit specific project requirements. The choice of architecture depends on factors such as application complexity, performance needs, SEO requirements, development team structure, and user experience goals.\n\n\n\n\nThe web has got more complicated, having a development team that can keep pace with the development and testing approaches, code structures and framework evolutions is difficult and probably very expensive. Multiple teams, different focuses Having one team develop a web application where everyone uses one JavaScript framework for the GUI and .NET for the APIs can have several benefits:\n\nConsistency: Using a single JavaScript framework for the GUI ensures consistent code style, architecture, and patterns across the frontend components. This simplifies collaboration, code reviews, and maintenance tasks within the development team.\nEfficient Communication: When the GUI and APIs are developed by the same team, communication between frontend and backend developers becomes more seamless. Developers can coordinate closely, align requirements, and address issues promptly.\nShared Expertise: By focusing on a single JavaScript framework, team members can deepen their expertise in that particular framework. This can result in faster development, efficient problem-solving, and improved overall quality of the frontend code.\nSeamless Integration: .NET is a versatile framework that offers excellent integration capabilities with various APIs and services. When the same team handles both the frontend and backend, they can ensure smooth communication and data flow between the GUI and the APIs, leading to a better overall user experience.\nFaster Development Iterations: With a unified team and shared knowledge, development iterations can be accelerated. Developers can iterate and deploy changes more quickly, as they have a deep understanding of both the frontend and backend components. This agility can be beneficial for meeting project deadlines and adapting to evolving requirements.\n\nHowever, there are some considerations to keep in mind:\n\nExpertise Balance: It’s important to ensure that the team has a balanced skill set, with expertise in both the chosen JavaScript framework and .NET for APIs. If the team members are primarily skilled in one area and lack proficiency in the other, it could lead to inefficiencies or a compromise in the quality of either the frontend or backend development.\nScalability: As the application grows and becomes more complex, a single team may face challenges in managing both the frontend and backend aspects simultaneously. In such cases, it may be necessary to divide the team or consider specialized roles to ensure efficient development and maintenance.\nFlexibility and Adaptability: Relying on a single JavaScript framework and .NET for APIs may limit the team’s flexibility when it comes to incorporating new technologies or frameworks that may better suit specific requirements. It’s important to periodically evaluate and adapt the technology stack to stay up-to-date with industry trends and evolving project needs. Ultimately, the decision to have one team develop both the GUI and APIs using specific technologies depends on factors such as the team’s expertise, project requirements, timelines, and scalability considerations.\n\nIn Hub 1.0 we have encountered all the negative considerations detailed above, so I’d advise against having multi-disciplinary developers, rather we should have Web GUI and API developers who specialise in their areas."

    "text": "When you use shared access signatures in your applications, you need to be aware of two potential risks:\n\nIf a SAS is leaked, it can be used by anyone who obtains it, which can potentially compromise your storage account.\nIf a SAS provided to a client application expires and the application is unable to retrieve a new SAS from your service, then the application’s functionality may be hindered.\n\nThe following recommendations for using shared access signatures can help mitigate these risks:\n\nAlways use HTTPS to create or distribute a SAS. If a SAS is passed over HTTP and intercepted, an attacker performing a man-in-the-middle attack is able to read the SAS and then use it just as the intended user could have, potentially compromising sensitive data or allowing for data corruption by the malicious user.\nReference stored access policies where possible. Stored access policies give you the option to revoke permissions without having to regenerate the storage account keys. Set the expiration on these very far in the future (or infinite) and make sure it’s regularly updated to move it farther into the future.\nUse near-term expiration times on an ad hoc SAS. In this way, even if a SAS is compromised, it’s valid only for a short time. This practice is especially important if you cannot reference a stored access policy. Near-term expiration times also limit the amount of data that can be written to a blob by limiting the time available to upload to it.\nHave clients automatically renew the SAS if necessary. Clients should renew the SAS well before the expiration, in order to allow time for retries if the service providing the SAS is unavailable. If your SAS is meant to be used for a small number of immediate, short-lived operations that are expected to be completed within the expiration period, then this may be unnecessary as the SAS is not expected to be renewed. However, if you have client that is routinely making requests via SAS, then the possibility of expiration comes into play. The key consideration is to balance the need for the SAS to be short-lived (as previously stated) with the need to ensure that the client is requesting renewal early enough (to avoid disruption due to the SAS expiring prior to successful renewal). Be careful with SAS start time. If you set the start time for a SAS to now, then due to clock skew (differences in current time according to different machines), failures may be observed intermittently for the first few minutes. In general, set the start time to be at least 15 minutes in the past. Or, don’t set it at all, which will make it valid immediately in all cases. The same generally applies to expiry time as well–remember that you may observe up to 15 minutes of clock skew in either direction on any request. For clients using a REST version prior to 2012-02-12, the maximum duration for a SAS that does not reference a stored access policy is 1 hour, and any policies specifying longer term than that will fail.\nBe specific with the resource to be accessed. A security best practice is to provide a user with the minimum required privileges. If a user only needs read access to a single entity, then grant them read access to that single entity, and not read/write/delete access to all entities. This also helps lessen the damage if a SAS is compromised because the SAS has less power in the hands of an attacker.\nUnderstand that your account will be billed for any usage, including that done with SAS. If you provide write access to a blob, a user may choose to upload a 200GB blob. If you’ve given them read access as well, they may choose to download it 10 times, incurring 2 TB in egress costs for you. Again, provide limited permissions to help mitigate the potential actions of malicious users. Use short-lived SAS to reduce this threat (but be mindful of clock skew on the end time).\nValidate data written using SAS. When a client application writes data to your storage account, keep in mind that there can be problems with that data. If your application requires that data be validated or authorized before it is ready to use, you should perform this validation after the data is written and before it is used by your application. This practice also protects against corrupt or malicious data being written to your account, either by a user who properly acquired the SAS, or by a user exploiting a leaked SAS.\nDon’t always use SAS. Sometimes the risks associated with a particular operation against your storage account outweigh the benefits of SAS. For such operations, create a middle-tier service that writes to your storage account after performing business rule validation, authentication, and auditing. Also, sometimes it’s simpler to manage access in other ways. For example, if you want to make all blobs in a container publicly readable, you can make the container Public, rather than providing a SAS to every client for access.\nUse Storage Analytics to monitor your application. You can use logging and metrics to observe any spike in authentication failures due to an outage in your SAS provider service or to the inadvertent removal of a stored access policy. See the Azure Storage Team Blog for additional information."

    "text": "Description\nA while a go I was working on a spreadsheet style applicaiton for the web, and we needed a method to store the 2 dimentional data in a 1 deminentional database. This was the resultant database structure, which is a linked list, which allowed both data and formula’s to included. There was either a template structure so you could load predefined sheets. I’ll get round to recreating the web page…. eventually.\n\n\n\nGreenDog\n\n\n\nTables\n\nR2Data\nR2Item\nR3Data\nR6TemplateItem\n\n\nItemId, ParentId, GdDdId, Format, DivisionId, Depth, ProcessId,

    "text": "Parameters\nFor Key Vaults I don’t like to specify the normal key/value pairs, as it would mean that I have to specify the name of the secret within the deployment script. The obvious draw back here is, as the code evolves and the secret changes then you would need to update both the parameters plus the deployment script. So first off in the parameters file put the secrets into an array.\n    \"para_kvSecretsObject\": {\n      \"value\": {\n        \"secrets\": [\n          {\n            \"secretName\": \"applicationuser\",\n            \"secretValue\": \"OVERWRITTEN BY VSTS\"\n          },\n          {\n            \"secretName\": \"AnotherSecret\",\n            \"secretValue\": \"OVERWRITTEN BY VSTS\"\n          }\n        ]\n      }\nStraight away you can see that the actual secret is injected from the CI tool, this is so you can inject a different secret depending on the environment. Putting the secrets into an array in this way means that we can cycle through the array in the deployment script without actually referring to the secret itself, only using the array index."

At the resource level we create a new feature which has a type of Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults/secrets. In the following code block the lines to look out for are the Copy/Name and Value properties. * The Copy property looks at the array and determines the number of items we need to process. * The Name property set the secret name to the ‘secrectName’ value in the array and it is indexed by the copyIndex() parameter * The Value is specified in the same way as the Name just using the secretValue array name.\nOne important line which is often overlooked is the DependsOn property. Each resource in the deployment file can be applied by Azure in parallel so by specifying the DependsOn property stops the deployment until the dependant resource exists.\n    {\n      \"apiVersion\": \"2015-06-01\",\n      \"copy\": {\n        \"name\": \"secretsCopy\",\n        \"count\": \"[length(parameters('para_kvSecretsObject').secrets)]\"\n      },\n      \"dependsOn\": [\n        \"[concat('Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults/', variables('var_kv_name'))]\"\n      ],\n      \"name\": \"[concat(variables('var_kv_name'), '/', parameters('para_kvSecretsObject').secrets[copyIndex()].secretName)]\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"value\": \"[parameters('para_kvSecretsObject').secrets[copyIndex()].secretValue]\"\n      },\n      \"tags\": {\n        \"displayName\": \"Key Vault Secrets\"\n      },\n      \"type\": \"Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults/secrets\"\n    }"

HTTP/2 now compresses those headers reducing the package size\n\nMultiplexing\n\nWeb pages can contain 100s of resources, in previous versions of HTTP each resource had to be requested individually in sequential order. With HTTP/2 your requests will be non blocking.\n\nSupported by all major browsers\n\nAll major browsers support HTTP/2, but if your browser doesnt then the protocol will be downgraded to HTTP 1.1\n\n\n\n\nReference\n\ngRPC\n\ngRPC.io\nGoogle gRPC\nMicrosoft gRPC\nYouTube - Blazor\n\nHTTP/2\n\nWikiPedia HTTP/2\nGoogle HTTP/2\nIETF HTTP Working Group\nYouTube - HTTP/2"

If you simply map to a table entity then your object will be missing the data.

That used to mean putting credentials into a configuration file or inserting them during a deployment process. The Manage Service Identities (MSI) facility has got around this by allowing all your resources to register a service principal with Active Directory, and then each resource grants the desired level of access to that service principal. By doing the security in this way, each of the resources never need to know credentials, they only request access and deal with the response. So, by removing credentials from the equation then there is no need to have to rotate passwords or update certs on a timely basis as they simply don�t exist between the resources.\n\n\nSo how do we accomplish this.\nWithin the azure function arm template declaration insert the following, this will register the function with your active directory.\n\"identity\": {\"type\": \"SystemAssigned\"},\nIn the variables section of the Arm Template, get the identity of the Azure Function.

    "text": "Description\nAPI First is an approach to software development that prioritizes the design and implementation of APIs before building the underlying application or service. This approach emphasizes the importance of APIs as the primary means of communication between different components of a system, as well as between different systems.\nBy designing APIs first, developers can ensure that the APIs are well-defined, consistent, and easy to use. This can lead to better collaboration between teams, faster development cycles, and more efficient integration with third-party services.\nThe approach detailed here takes the responsibility for creating the API definition away from the developer and places it in the hands of a specialist tool. This ensures that the API definition is created in a consistent manner and adheres to best practices. The API definition is then used to generate the client and server code, which can be integrated into the application or service. This approach can help to reduce errors and inconsistencies in the code, as well as improve the overall quality of the API. The API First approach can be particularly beneficial in complex systems where multiple teams are working on different components. By defining the APIs first, teams can work independently while still ensuring that their components will integrate seamlessly with the rest of the system. The API First approach can also help to improve the overall user experience of the application or service. By designing APIs that are easy to use and understand, developers can create applications that are more intuitive and user-friendly. Overall, the API First approach is a powerful way to improve the development process and create high-quality applications and services that are built around well-designed APIs."

These templates are designed to help developers create clear and comprehensive specifications that can be used to guide AI-driven code generation.\nSpec-kit templates follow the CARE framework, which stands for Context, Action, Result, and Evaluation. This framework helps ensure that specifications are detailed and structured in a way that minimizes ambiguity and enhances the quality of AI-generated code.\nSpec-Kit includes templates for a variety of features, such as user authentication, data validation, API endpoints, and more. Each template provides a structured format that developers can fill out with specific details relevant to their project.\nSpec-kit aims to streamline the process of creating AI-ready specifications, making it easier for developers to leverage AI tools effectively in their code development workflows.\nSpec-kit works with most AI code generation tools, including OpenAI’s Codex, GitHub Copilot, and Anthropic’s Claude. By using these templates, developers can improve the accuracy and reliability of the code generated by AI models.\nSpec-kit is a CLI that is installed and run locally from VS Code. Spec-kit sets up a .specify folder in your project root with markdown templates for common features. The .specify folder will intitally contain templates such as:\n* Memory - which should include your constituional principles for AI code generation.\n* Scripts - which contains helper scripts to generate SPEC.md files from templates.\n* Templates - which contains markdown files for various common features.\nThe .specify/Templates folder includes the following AI-Ready Specification Templates:\n\nREADME.md - Overview of Spec-kit and how to use it.\n\nspec-driven.md - Guide to Spec-Driven Development and CARE framework.\nauth-spec.md - AI-Ready Specification Template for User Authentication feature.\ndata-validation-spec.md - AI-Ready Specification Template for Data Validation feature.\napi-endpoint-spec.md - AI-Ready Specification Template for API Endpoint feature.\npagination-spec.md - AI-Ready Specification Template for Pagination feature.\nerror-handling-spec.md - AI-Ready Specification Template for Error Handling feature.\nlogging-spec.md - AI-Ready Specification Template for Logging feature.\nrate-limiting-spec.md - AI-Ready Specification Template for Rate Limiting feature.\nfile-upload-spec.md - AI-Ready Specification Template for File Upload feature.\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nGithub Spec-kit description\nGithub Spec-kit"

    "text": "AI driven code development is a powerful tool, but it is only as good as the data and instructions it receives. If the input is flawed or incomplete, the output will likely be unreliable. This principle, often summarized as “Garbage In, Garbage Out” (GIGO), highlights the importance of providing high-quality data and clear requirements when leveraging AI for code generation. To ensure the effectiveness of AI-driven code development, it is crucial to:\n\nDefine Clear Requirements: Clearly articulate the desired functionality, performance criteria, and constraints of the code to be generated. This helps the AI understand the context and objectives.\nProvide Quality Data: Use accurate, relevant, and well-structured data to train and guide the AI models. Poor-quality data can lead to incorrect or suboptimal code generation.\nIterative Refinement: Continuously review and refine the generated code. Human oversight is essential to identify and correct any issues, ensuring that the final output meets the required standards.\nTesting and Validation: Rigorously test the generated code to verify its functionality, performance, and security. Automated testing frameworks can be employed to streamline this process.\n\nBy adhering to these principles, developers can maximize the benefits of AI-driven code development while minimizing the risks associated with flawed inputs.",

    "text": "About to start a project to evaluate the different documentation systems that are available for software architecture. The goal is to find the best fit for our team’s needs.\nTto alow architects to write their documenation using their own favorite tools. Whether it’s markdown, reStructuredText, or even plain text files.\nNeed to all use the same git storage system to keep everything organized and version controlled.\nWill need to support different diagramming tools as well. Some architects prefer using PlantUML, mermaid, structurizr, or even visio.\nWill need to create templates and guidelines to ensure consistency across all documentation.\nPricing\nDocumentation tools\n\nGitHub Pages\nAzure Devops Wiki\nDocusaurus\nGitBook\nDocument360\nRead The Docs\nQuarto\nConfluense\nNotion\nMkDocs\n\n\n\n\nThese tools generate a website from plain-text files stored in your GitHub repository. The documentation lives alongside your code, and the entire software development workflow (pull requests, versioning, code reviews) is used for the documentation as well.\n\nMkDocs: A fast and simple static site generator written in Python, geared towards technical documentation. It uses Markdown source files and has a variety of themes and plugins available.\nDocusaurus: An open-source static site generator built on React that is popular for documentation sites. It is easy to use and provides a modern look and feel with built-in search and versioning features.\nDocFX: A static site generator for building and publishing API documentation for .NET projects, but can also be used for general Markdown documentation. It’s developed by Microsoft and is highly customizable.\nJekyll: One of the original static site generators, powered by Ruby. It is the engine behind GitHub Pages, making it a seamless option for hosting your documentation directly from your GitHub repo for free.\n\n\n\n\nArchitecture documentation often requires diagrams. These tools allow you to define diagrams using text-based syntax, which can be versioned in Git like the rest of your documentation.\n\nPlantUML and Mermaid: These tools render simple text-based descriptions into diagrams (UML, C4 model, flowcharts, etc.). GitHub natively supports rendering Mermaid diagrams inline within Markdown files, which is a significant advantage.\nStructurizr: This tool is based on the C4 model for visualizing software architecture. It allows you to create diagrams and documentation from a single model using code or a Domain Specific Language (DSL), perfect for technical people who want to manage architecture rigorously in source control.\nDraw.io (now diagrams.net): While it has a traditional UI editor, it also offers a C4 model plugin and can store diagram definitions in a version-control-friendly format (like XML or text) within your GitHub repo.\n\n\n\n\nIf you prefer a hosted solution with a more traditional editing interface but still want your source content in GitHub, some SaaS products offer synchronization.\n\nGitBook: A modern platform for creating and managing documentation. It can connect to your GitHub repository and automatically sync content, providing a polished user interface while keeping the source in Git.\nNotion or Confluence (with integration): While their primary storage isn’t Git, they can be integrated or used in conjunction with a docs-as-code approach to serve different audiences, with the source of truth remaining in the GitHub repo.\n\nThe “docs-as-code” approach using a static site generator and plain text files is generally considered best practice for software architecture documentation because it aligns with engineering workflows and facilitates version control and collaboration within the existing toolset.\n\n\n\nQuarto is an open-source scientific and technical publishing system that allows you to create dynamic content using Markdown and integrate executable code (Python, R, Julia, etc.) into your documentation.\n\nGitHub Repo as Storage: Yes, this is Quarto’s native approach. Your documentation is authored in plain-text Markdown files (or .qmd files) and stored directly in your GitHub repository alongside your code.\nWorkflow: It fully embraces the “docs-as-code” philosophy. You use your standard development tools (VS Code, RStudio, command line) to edit files and the entire process (pull requests, code review, versioning) is managed via Git and GitHub.\nPublishing: Quarto can be published to a variety of destinations, including GitHub Pages, using the quarto publish command or automated with GitHub Actions.\nBest for: Highly technical teams who want documentation to be a seamless part of their existing engineering workflow and codebase, and require a high degree of customisation and the ability to embed code execution results.\n\n\n\n\nDocument360 is a full-featured, hosted knowledge base platform designed for creating, managing, and publishing both internal and external user documentation.\n\nGitHub Repo as Storage: No, not as its primary storage. Document360 stores your content in its own cloud-based database (MongoDB/Azure Blob Storage).\nWorkflow: It provides a user-friendly, web-based editor (which supports Markdown) and a more traditional content management system (CMS) experience with features like versioning, analytics, and a homepage builder.\nGitHub Integration: It offers an integration with GitHub that allows for a one-way sync of Markdown files from a GitHub repository into Document360. The synced articles are read-only within Document360’s editor; any changes must be made in the source GitHub repository and then synced back.\n\nBest for: Teams where technical writers and non-developers are primary content creators, who prefer a polished UI and dedicated documentation features (like analytics, detailed access control, etc.), but still want the content source to originate from a GitHub repo.\nGiven this list of documentation platforms.\n\nGitHub Pages\nAzure Devops Wiki\nDocusaurus\nGitBook\nDocument360\nRead The Docs\nQuarto\nConfluense\nNotion\nMkDocs\n\nwhich best meet our requirements of:\n\n20 active contributing users\n1000+ readonly users\nGithub backed document repository\nSupport for Markdown\nSupport for Plantuml, Mermaid, Stucturizr\n\nThe best options that meet all requirements, especially the GitHub-backed document repository, are the open-source static site generators such as Docusaurus, MkDocs, Quarto, and GitHub Pages. These platforms fully support the “docs-as-code” workflow required by a GitHub-backed repository. Here is a breakdown of why these are the top choices and how they meet your needs:\n\nGitHub-backed document repository: All these tools use plain Markdown files stored in your GitHub repo as the source of truth.\n20 active contributing users: The contribution model leverages standard Git workflows (pull requests, branching, code reviews), which scales well for active engineering teams.\n1000+ readonly users: Static site generators produce highly performant, scalable websites that can handle thousands of concurrent read-only users without performance issues.\nSupport for Markdown: Markdown is the native authoring format for all of them.\nSupport for PlantUML, Mermaid, Structurizr: Mermaid is natively supported by GitHub and many of these generators. PlantUML and Structurizr are also widely supported through extensions, plugins, or pre-processing during the build pipeline.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlatform\nNotes\n\n\n\n\nDocusaurus\nExcellent balance of modern design, ease of use, built-in features (search, versioning), and a React-based structure for customization.\n\n\nMkDocs\nSimple, fast, and highly effective for technical documentation, using Python. Easy to configure plugins for diagram support.\n\n\nQuarto\nIdeal for technical and scientific documentation, integrating executable code and advanced formatting capabilities.\n\n\nGitHub Pages\nThe underlying hosting platform for the others (often used with Jekyll or MkDocs), offering a seamless, free hosting solution directly from your repo.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAzure DevOps Wiki: Its primary storage is not a GitHub repo (it uses an Azure repo for “code wiki”), and native support for all diagram types (especially PlantUML and Structurizr) is limited without workarounds.\nConfluence & Notion: These are traditional CMS/wiki platforms where the primary storage is their own database, not your GitHub repo. While integrations exist, they often rely on one-way syncs or embedding, which doesn’t fully align with the “GitHub-backed” requirement.\nDocument360 & GitBook: These are SaaS products. GitBook started with open-source roots but now operates as a hosted solution with sync capabilities. Document360 offers a one-way sync from GitHub, but the source of truth within the app is its own database.\nRead The Docs: Excellent for hosting documentation, particularly Sphinx projects, but often used for existing projects rather than a standalone platform choice like Docusaurus or MkDocs for greenfield projects. It still fits the requirements as a hosting solution for content from a GitHub repo.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe best fit version applications use the following versions of Markdown.\n\nDocusaurus uses MDX by default, which is a superset of GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM) that allows you to embed JSX (React components) within your Markdown content. It can be configured to use a stricter CommonMark format if needed.\nMkDocs uses the Python-Markdown library, which is nearly completely compliant with the original Markdown reference implementation. It gains additional features, including support for diagrams and other advanced syntax, through extensions.\nQuarto is based on Pandoc Markdown, an extended and slightly revised version of John Gruber’s original Markdown syntax. Pandoc Markdown is a highly flexible and powerful superset that adds features necessary for technical and academic publishing, such as citations, cross-references, and definition lists.\nGitHub Pages uses GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM) as its default, which is a formal specification based on the CommonMark standard. GFM is a strict superset of CommonMark, adding useful extensions like tables, strikethrough, task lists, and automatic linking of URLs and GitHub-specific references (issues, commits, users).\n\nIn summary, all four options are either based on the highly compatible CommonMark or GFM specifications, ensuring that your documentation is largely portable and readable across different platforms.\n\n\n\nRepresenting PlantUML and Structurizr diagrams in the recommended applications is generally achieved using plugins, extensions, or by generating images as part of your build pipeline. Since these tools use static site generation, the diagrams are typically converted to SVG or PNG images at build time rather than rendered dynamically in the browser.\n\n\nDocusaurus natively supports Mermaid, but PlantUML and Structurizr require community plugins or build-time generation.\n\nPlantUML: Use a plugin like remark-kroki or similar Docusaurus PlantUML plugins that convert plantuml code blocks to images during the build process, often using a public or private PlantUML server.\nStructurizr: A dedicated docusaurus-plugin-structurizr exists to generate diagrams from Structurizr DSL files (.dsl) and embed them into your markdown pages.\nMermaid: Docusaurus has native support for Mermaid via a simple configuration in docusaurus.config.js, making it a very seamless option.\n\n\n\n\nMkDocs has a rich ecosystem of plugins that handle diagram generation effectively.\n\nPlantUML: The mkdocs-plantuml-plugin is widely used. It requires a PlantUML server (which you can run locally via Docker) to render diagrams from puml code blocks in your markdown files during the build phase.\nStructurizr: You can use the Structurizr CLI to generate PlantUML files from your DSL, and then use the PlantUML plugin to render those. Alternatively, you can use the mkdocs-kroki-plugin which supports Structurizr DSL directly.\nMermaid: The Material for MkDocs theme has first-class support for Mermaid and other diagram libraries via its integration with the Kroki service.\n\n\n\n\nQuarto has native support for several diagram formats.\n\nPlantUML & Structurizr: Quarto does not have direct, native PlantUML rendering built-in like Mermaid. You would likely rely on pre-generating the image files (using a GitHub Action or local script with the PlantUML JAR/server) and then embedding them as standard Markdown images. Quarto’s general flexibility with Pandoc filters might allow for a more integrated approach, but this requires more configuration.\nMermaid & Graphviz: Quarto has native, out-of-the-box support for Mermaid and Graphviz diagrams embedded within special executable cells (e.g., ```{mermaid}).\n\n\n\n\nGitHub Pages uses Jekyll by default, and its capabilities are dependent on the plugins GitHub allows to run in its environment.\n\nMermaid: GitHub added native support for rendering Mermaid diagrams in Markdown files, which works seamlessly on GitHub Pages.\nPlantUML & Structurizr: GitHub Pages runs in “safe mode”, which restricts custom plugins. To use PlantUML or Structurizr with GitHub Pages, you must generate the SVG/PNG image files as part of your CI/CD pipeline (e.g., using GitHub Actions) and commit those images to your repository. You then reference the generated image files in your Markdown using standard image syntax . You cannot render them live within the Markdown source blocks on the GitHub Pages server itself."

The reason for using KeyVault rather than using a local config file, is really quite simple. config files dont exist for most azure artefacts, and if they did, it would encourage the sort of key management that has plagued .NET since day one. By using the KeyVault in this way means that the application code doesn’t need to know anything about the environment or its configuration.

This allows me to create a development environment that is isolated from my local machine. This is great for testing and debugging code without having to worry about breaking my local environment.\nInorder to use dev containers in VSCode, you need to install the extensions WSL and Dev Containers. Once you have these installed, you can create a dev container by creating a .devcontainer folder in your project and adding a devcontainer.json file. This file will contain the configuration for your dev container.\n\n\nPodman Settings\nI have been using Podman as my container runtime and I have found it to be a great alternative to Docker. In order to use Podman with VSCode, you need to set the “docker.dockerPath” setting to the path of the Podman executable. This will allow VSCode to use Podman instead of Docker when running containers.\n\n\nReferences\n\nVSCode\nVSCode Dev Containers",

Where your class is interfacing with a different system such as being used in a API interface, then you need to convey to the user the maximum amount of information, about what is or isnt valid, so the validation details have to be encoded in the model. Where Data Annotations is lacking, E.g. OneOf, AnyOf, then you should build a custom validator to fill the gap.\nFluent Validation should be used internally, as it not only can apply general validations, it can also encode groups of validations into rules and apply them under different conditions.\n\n\nRef\nThis is a interesting read on validators, and also the implementation of custom validators. https://weblogs.asp.net/ricardoperes/net-8-data-annotations-validation"

    "text": "What if you could create diagrams first, and then generate code from them? This is the idea behind diagram first coding, a software development approach that emphasizes visual representation of system architecture before writing any code.\nThis isnt so far fetched. Look at tools like C4, where the system is modeled using a series of heirarchical diagrams, which denote the strucutre of the system at different levels of abstraction. These diagrams can then be used to generate code stubs, which can be filled in with business logic later.\nThats the rub, systems like this always push to one side complexity to other systems when it gets too difficult to model. For example, you might model the high level architecture of a web application using C4 diagrams, but then have to resort to traditional coding for the detailed implementation of the business logic. However, with advances in model-driven development and code generation tools, its becoming increasingly feasible to adopt a diagram first coding approach. By leveraging these tools, developers can create more maintainable and scalable systems, as the visual representation of the architecture provides a clear understanding of the system’s structure and behavior.\nSo for example you might create a C4 diagram that models the high level architecture, and then APIFirst tools to generate the API endpoints and data models. This way, you can ensure that the code is aligned with the architecture, while still allowing for flexibility in the implementation of the business logic."

    "text": "So what is Business Logic?\nBusiness logic refers to the rules and processes that govern how a system operates and interacts with its users. It encompasses the core functionality of the application, including data processing, decision-making, and workflow management. In a diagram first coding approach, business logic can be represented visually through flowcharts, state diagrams, or other modeling techniques, allowing developers to better understand and communicate the system’s behavior before writing any code.\nSo its the logic inside a C4 Component that makes it do what it does. The code part of C4 provides the class hirarchy, but the business logic is what makes those classes actually do something useful. The business logic could be described in a variety of ways, such as pseudocode, flowcharts, or even natural language descriptions.\nThis is beginning to sound more like lego than coding. You have a set of pre-defined blocks (the C4 components) that you can snap together to create a system. Having a business logic engineer define the behavior of each block, and using a locode tool to generate the code for each block based on its defined behavior.\nA software developer would glue the blocks together, and ensure that they work together as intended. This approach could potentially lead to faster development times, as well as more maintainable and scalable systems."

    "text": "How to build Cloud components without any Azure Experience\nIt is a bit of a misnomer; you need people with cloud experience.\nSorry I am not going to say anything new here, but it just might be new here.\nIn typical application code is the same no matter what platform you develop on, you have an interface to the world, domain/business rules, and a data interface. Only the interface to the world needs to be managed by someone with more specialised knowledge. You could divide up the code and create two projects, one for the API, specialised to the environment it will be deployed, and one for the domain/business logic. This would enable you to simply wrap the domain/business rules in its own NuGet package and use normal developers to create them and allow them to use tradition tools to build and evaluate them.\n\n\n\npackage1\n\n\nThe previous solution would be fine, but it still leaves scope for organically grown code, which encapsulates complex business rules. The build test burden could be reduced further by making the projects even smaller. Reducing their complexity and increasing their automatic testability. In this case the Domain logic could be reduced to encoding process flow only, and business rules evaluation could be managed by a more suitable tool. Also if the data store interface is not specific to this application but a general interface used by many applications, then it also could make use of package management.\n\n\n\npackage2\n\n\nThe questions, I keep hearing when there is a proposed change in development strategy, such as • How do we keep up with package versioning • How do we make sure all applications are using the same package versions\nThe simple answer is developers should use good development practices.\n\nAt the start of any new development, they should\n\nRun the unit tests\nGet the latest packages\nRun the unit tests\nFix any issues caused by the updated packages\nRun the unit tests\n\nCreate new code\nCreate new tests\n\nRun the unit tests\n\nCreate a check in note\nCheck in\n\nThe only project where package version matters is the API project, as that what is presented to the user."

Moving forward with a service-oriented application design, the code should be split along functional lines, where each function becomes a self-contained package which can be reused.

We are then going to specify objects of type “blobServices/containers”, and make sure to use an API version of 2018-02-01 or later. In the example below, we are creating a storage account with two containers.\n{\n    \"type\": \"Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts\",\n    \"apiVersion\": \"2018-02-01\",\n    \"name\": \"[parameters('StorageAccountName')]\",\n    \"location\": \"[resourceGroup().location]\",\n    \"tags\": {\n        \"displayName\": \"[parameters('StorageAccountName')]\"\n    },\n    \"sku\": {\n        \"name\": \"Standard_LRS\"\n    },\n    \"kind\": \"StorageV2\",\n    \"properties\": {},\n    \"resources\": [\n        {\n            \"type\": \"blobServices/containers\",\n            \"apiVersion\": \"2018-03-01-preview\",\n            \"name\": \"[concat('default/', parameters('Container1Name'))]\",\n            \"dependsOn\": [\n                \"[parameters('StorageAccountName')]\"\n            ],\n            \"properties\": {\n                \"publicAccess\": \"Container\"\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"type\": \"blobServices/containers\",\n            \"apiVersion\": \"2018-03-01-preview\",\n            \"name\": \"[concat('default/', parameters('Container2Name'))]\",\n            \"dependsOn\": [\n                \"[parameters('StorageAccountName')]\"\n            ],\n            \"properties\": {\n                \"publicAccess\": \"None\"\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\nWe can then go ahead and deploy this, and see the two containers being created. You can see in the template we are setting different Public Access properties on the two containers, you have a choice of 3 values here: None (private container) Container (the whole container is publically accessible) Blob (only Blobs are publically accessible)\nThe above example is fine, but you need to specify each of the containers as separate parameters, and remember to add the correct number of container clauses to the script.\nSo if we specify the containers as a array in the parameters file\n    \"para_storageObject\": {\n      \"value\": {\n        \"containers\": [\n          {\n            \"containerName\": \"files\"\n          },\n          {\n            \"containerName\": \"elephants\"\n          },\n          {\n            \"containerName\": \"bananas\"\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n    },\nThen we can use a copy clause to cycle over the array and create our containers in the deploy\n    {\n      \"apiVersion\": \"2018-03-01-preview\",\n      \"copy\": {\n        \"name\": \"containersCopy\",\n        \"count\": \"[length(parameters('para_storageObject').containers)]\"\n      },\n      \"dependsOn\": [\n        \"[concat('Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/', variables('var_str_name'))]\"\n      ],\n      \"name\": \"[concat(variables('var_str_name'), '/default/', parameters('para_storageObject').containers[copyIndex()].containerName)]\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"publicAccess\": \"Container\"\n      },\n      \"tags\": {\n        \"displayName\": \"StorageAcct/Containers\"\n      },\n      \"type\": \"Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/blobServices/containers\"\n    },"

For us to write a Anti Virus scanning tool is out of the question, even employing a piece of opensource software is not advisable, as we have no idea how upto date the virus templates are, or even if they are valid.\nA solution would be to send any prospective file to a external third party who specialises in file scanning and verification. A possible solution is descibed below.\n\n\n\nFile-AV-Scanning\n\n\n\n\nA Solution\n\nA file is uploaded via a a Wb Upload tool.\nThe web application registers its interest in file upload statuses with the SignalR handler\nThe file is passed to the Document API\nThe Document API passes the document to a Third Party AV scanning company.\n\nBecause a document could contain more than one file, It could take the Third Party a while to scan the complete document, so they normally make use of a Webhook interface so they can asynchronously send back a response.\n\nThe Document API receives a response and posts a success or fail message to the Event Grid File Upload Topic.\nIf the AV response was a success the file is written to the blob storage.\n\nThe notification pattern of EventGrid Topic/ Azure Function / Azure SignalR is a standard pattern. There is also a pattern for securing webhooks, although webhooks are not loved by all."

    "section": "Key Considerations",
    "text": "Key Considerations\n\nAuthentication: The WOPI protocol uses an access_token query parameter for authentication on initial requests. For subsequent operations (like PutFile), tokens might be passed in HTTP headers (Authorization or X-WOPI-Token). Your functions must validate this token on every single request.\nWOPI Headers: Many operations rely heavily on custom HTTP headers starting with X-WOPI- (e.g., X-WOPI-Override, X-WOPI-Lock). You’ll need to read and respond to these headers in your Azure Functions.\nFile Locking: For edit operations, you must implement the Lock, Unlock, and RefreshLock operations using the X-WOPI-Lock header to prevent concurrent edits.\nWOPI Validator: Microsoft provides a WOPI Validator tool that you can use to test your implementation during development. Deployment: Your Azure Functions app must be publicly accessible on the internet for Microsoft 365 for the web to reach it.\nPnP-WOPI Sample: The Microsoft OfficeDev/PnP-WOPI repository on GitHub provides a solid ASP.NET MVC sample which can be used as a reference for the logic needed, even if the hosting model is different."
